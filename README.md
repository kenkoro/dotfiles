# Welcome, nerds

In my second year of uni, I've started using stow as a farm manager which takes distinct sets of
software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem,
and makes them all appear to be installed in a single directory tree. If
you're interested in figuring out how it works, [then check out here][blog],
and also I've learned from [bashbunni][bashbunni], so check [her repo][bbdotfiles] as well.

## Content of this repo
Later I'll add here more dotfiles and some explanations.
